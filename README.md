# AngularApp
This is my college assignments repo

change the script sources for bootstrap and AngularJs to CDN links

OR

create a folder node_modules and copy the following folders in it:

/angular and
/angular-translate

Inside node_modules create another folder bootstrap and copy following folders and files in it:
/dist
/fonts
/grunt
/js
/less

and files: CHANGELOG.md, Gruntfile.js, LICENSE and package.json.

Thank you.
